# 2025-10-01 ESGF-NG Status

ESGF-NG status as of October 1, 2025.

**NOTE:** ESGF-NG will be used for CMIP7 and subsequent activities. *None of the below applies to CMIP6 or earlier activities.*

## ESGF-NG Project Description
ESGF-NG is the next generation of the core architecture for the Earth System Grid Federation. Designed in 2024 and deployed in 2025, it replaces the ESGF-1.0 core architecture. See [ESGF-NG Docs](../docs/README.md) for further information.

## Design Status
Our current work is still consistent with the [design as written](https://github.com/ESGF/esgf-roadmap/core_architecture/design.md).

One significant addition (that doesn't change any of the written design) is a dependency in the STAC Transaction API on STAC extensions created by the [esg-vocab](https://github.com/ESGF/esgf-vocab) (aka ESGVOC) project.
* When a catalog item is added or updated using the STAC API, the item's metadata schema and controlled vocabulary are validated against the JSON schemas defined by the relevant STAC extensions.
* This validation occurs *before* an event is created on the ESGF event stream.
* All ESGF STAC extensions are registered with the STAC community's extensions repository.
* **IMPORTANT:** This addition means that before an ESGF project can publish items, the project must register its metadata schema and controlled vocabularies with the ESGVOC project and the ESGVOC project must publish a STAC extension for the project.

## Status Updates
Updates are divided into two sections: data challenges and component status. Data challenges are end-to-end tests of the ESGF-NG core architecture and related components, by which we assure ourselves that the system is ready for CMIP7 publishing and discovery. The component status sections provide details about individual sub-components of the ESGF-NG core architecture. (Component details become less important as time passes.)

### Data Challenges
The ESGF-NG team is currently conducting a series of [data challenges](https://github.com/ESGF/esgf-roadmap/tree/main/data-challenges) (trial runs of the ESGF-NG system) to validate the expected behavior of the end-to-end ESGF-NG system.

* **Completed:** [Data Challenge 1 (rounds 1 & 2)](https://github.com/ESGF/esgf-roadmap/blob/main/data-challenges/01-Publication.md), end-to-end publication. CEDA and Globus each published 500+ unique datasets (drawn from CMIP6) to their own STAC catalogs. When finished, the two STAC catalogs were compared to confirm they were synchronized and both catalogs had all entries.
* **Completed:** Data Challenge [02](https://github.com/ESGF/esgf-roadmap/blob/main/data-challenges/02-Retraction.md) & [03](https://github.com/ESGF/esgf-roadmap/blob/main/data-challenges/03-Update.md), end-to-end publication, update, and retraction, including ESGF client application testing. We identified a small number of issues as a result of this challenge and have plans for resolving each of them. **We need ESGF client applications to test against the resulting STAC catalogs and event stream.** (We are counting on the ESGF XC to coordinate the latter testing activity with us and with individual client application teams.)
* **Next Up:** *Load Testing* - We are preparing a large batch of input data (100,000+ new item and item update requests) for load testing. Our plan is to submit STAC catalog change requests at a rate of at least 1000/hour for 48 hours. The goal is to see if the East and West systems can process requests at this rate without falling behind and identify the component(s) that limit the processing rate.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** During load testing, we will perform each test run twice: once with custom STAC extensions our team maintains and shares in our [shared Github repo](https://github.com/ESGF/stac-transaction-api/), and a second time with the most recent STAC extensions generated by the ESGVOC project. (We expect the latter to change more slowly than the former.) The first runs will allow us to continue code testing at our own pace while the ESGVOC STAC extensions reach stability. The second runs will generate feedback to the ESGVOC and ESGF CV projects.

Reminder: We still have no technical design for handling catalog consistency errors published on the ESGF event stream by the event consumer. Our plan is to monitor the errors that occur and use that to develop an error-handing strategy, which will likely be a combination of manual and automated processing.

### ESGF-NG Components

#### Metadata Schema and Controlled Vocabularies
The ESGF STAC catalogs enforce metadata schema and controlled vocabulary validation for all catalog additions and updates. STAC extensions (JSON schemas) published by the ESGVOC team (one per ESGF project), and based on schema and CVs provided by the ESGF CV team, provide the basis for this validation. The data challenges run in September and October will test this feature.

The ESGVOC team has prepared initial versions of STAC extensions for CMIP6, input4MIPS, obs4MIPS, and obs4REF. At present, these extensions do not successfully validate a significant portion of previously published CMIP6 data. We continue to provide feedback to ESGFVOC and ESG CV teams to resolve these issues.

We have informed the ESGF WIP and the ESGVOC team that it is essential that each ESGF project supply JSON schema and STAC extensions before the project will be able to publish data using ESGF-NG.

#### STAC Discovery API
This is the API used by ESGF client applications to discover ESGF datasets. Each of the East and West STAC Catalogs provides a STAC Discovery API. Both East and West use the STAC community's [STAC-FastAPI](https://github.com/stac-utils/stac-fastapi) implementation, but they use different backends. (East uses an [ElasticSearch backend](https://github.com/stac-utils/stac-fastapi-elasticsearch-opensearch), West uses a [Globus Search backend](https://github.com/esgf2-us/west-discovery).)

During September, the West discovery API was updated to add support for several missing STAC search filters, results paging, and term count aggregations (also known as "facets"). The Globus team closely followed the code examples provided by the ElasticSearch backend, adapted to Globus Search.

The [discovery API endpoint from Data Challenge 03](https://data-challenge-04-discovery.api.stac.esgf-west.org/) has these new features deployed and is available for client testing.

#### Event Consumer
[No significant changes since last month.]

The Event Consumer subscribes to the ESGF Event Stream, reads events from the stream, and performs the corresponding changes in a STAC Catalog. These changes may be addition of new items (PUT) or changes to existing items (POST, PATCH). If the Event Consumer detects a consistency error, it publishes an error to the ESGF Event Stream's error topic. The ESGF event consumer supports (via configuration) either an ElasticSearch or Globus Search index as its backend.

NOTE: The error event schema is preliminary and may change to address issues identified during testing or early data publication.

#### STAC Transaction API
[No significant changes since last month.]

The Transaction API enables STAC clients to make changes to the catalog. These changes may be addition of new items (POST) or changes to an existing item (PUT, PATCH). ESGF's STAC catalogs will understand DELETE requests but no client will be authorized to perform them. For each request, the STAC Transaction API:
1. confirms the authorization of the request,
2. validates the item metadata, and
3. posts an event on the ESGF Event Stream.

It does not implement the change in the catalog. Instead, it posts an event on the ESGF event stream with the details of the required change. The catalog change itself is performed by the Event Consumers for each ESGF STAC catalog.

Data Challenge 03 tested all of the functionality described above. We believe the validation code (both for new items and for item changes) is complete and have tested it with our own version of the CMIP6 STAC extension. The metadata validation is still causing issues when using the ESGVOC-generate CMIP6 STAC extension because the CMIP6 CV is not yet stable.

### Event Stream
[No significant changes since last month.]

The ESGF event stream service is operated by Globus as part of the ESGF2-US project.  We are currently using [Confluent Data Streaming](https:/www.confluent.io), a managed Apache Kafka deployment hosted in AWS.

The event stream is currently being used for our ESGF-NG data challenges.
* Write access (ability to post events) is restricted to the East and West STAC catalogs.
* Read access (ability to subscribe to topics and read events) is limited to the CEDA and Globus teams who are conducting the data challenges.
* **We also granted Read access to engineers for the ESGF PID team.** They are evaluating the Event Stream for use in a new version of the ESGF PID service. They are using events generated from our data challenges in this evaluation. Their feedback has already led to improvements to ESGVOC's CMIP6 metadata schema.

We expect to onboard engineers for the ESGF Rapid Evaluation Framework (REF) team in August or September to enable them to explore the event stream with events from one or more ESGF-NG data challenges.

Before beginning production operation, we expect we will redeploy the service on a new Kafka cluster within the Confluent service. This should have no effect on clients other than an endpoint address change.

#### Authentication and Authorization
[No significant changes since last month.]

The STAC Transaction API (see above) authenticates all client requests and authorizes requests against active project and data node registrations. The system used for authentication and authorization is configurable.
* For the ESGF-West STAC catalog, authentication is performed via Globus, and registration is performed via Globus Group memberships.
* For the ESGF-East STAC catalog, authentication is performed via EGI-Check In and registration is performed via EGI-Check In attributes.

As of September 2, 2025, we've tested all of the above functionality and it is working as expected.

We have one open issue, which is to enable separate authorization policies for replica add and replica remove operations. Separate policies are needed because for these operations, authorization should be based on the data node making the change, rather than the modeling team making the change.

NOTE: The current EGI-Check In implementation uses the OIDC authorization code flow. At some point in the future (as a low-priority development), CEDA plans to change this to the OIDC device flow.

#### Catalog Consistency Errors
[No significant changes since last month.]

When catalog changes are requested via the STAC API (new items or updates to existing items), the API is not designed to return an error code to the calling client application if the change cannot be made in the catalog because of a consistency error. (E.g., if a new item is published and it conflicts with an existing item, or if a retraction is requested and the item does not exist.) Instead, the API always returns a code indicating a deferred operation. If the change cannot be made in the STAC catalog, the catalog will generate an error on the ESGF Event Stream's "errors" topic.

We currently do not have a plan for how to respond to errors reported on the Event Stream.

### Discovery and Data Access Applications
All pre-CMIP7 ESGF discovery and data access applications must be updated to use the new STAC catalog(s). Because we are now using STAC, we can now use STAC applications that have been in widespread use by the geospatial data community.

On completion of each data challenge, we have made the resulting STAC catalogs (both East and West) available for client application testing. We are counting on the ESGF XC to coordinate this testing with us and the individual client application teams. **We expect this testing will result in issues that we will need to resolve (it already is!), so it's important that this testing happen as soon as possible and with as many client applications as possible.**

Clients of the ESGF-NG Event Stream:
* ESGF Rapid Evaluation Framework (REF)
* ESGF Persistent IDentifiers (PID) Service

Clients of the ESGF-NG STAC catalogs:
* Radiant Earth STAC Browser
* DKRZ’s customisation of the STAC Browser. (Includes support for JupyterLite and visualisations)
* Metagrid
* Intake-esgf
* Esg-pull
* Wget-API
* CMCC
* Climate4Impact
* ESMValTool
* ESGF-py-client - we intend to deprecate this application

### Production Deployments
[No significant changes since last month.]

* **Both catalogs:**
  * Both East and West have performed multiple deployments of the STAC Transaction API, Event Consumer, and STAC Discovery API for the data challenges. We are preparing documentation and plans for these deployments to be handled by local operations personnel by the time we launch the public ESGF-NG service.
  * East and West are using common STAC Transaction API code (with separate configs for auth, Globus v. EGI Check-In) and common event consumer code (with separate backends: Globus Search and ElasticSearch).
  * The catalogs still use separate STAC Discovery API code. (No plans to change that, presently.)
  * Code to support controlled vocabulary validation is pending a feature release from the ESGVOC project.
* **West catalog:**
  * The West catalog supports Globus authentication and authorization and uses a Globus Search backend.
* **East catalog:**
  * The East catalog supports EGI Check-In authentication and authorization and uses an ElasticSearch backend (hosted on JASMIN).

The CEDA team is looking into moving its STAC API to the production URL.

The Globus team is working with our Operations team and acquisitions at Argonne National Laboratory to deploy production deployments of the ESGF-West core architecture.

### Publisher Registration
[No significant changes since last month.]

Publisher registration for both East and West STAC catalogs is currently a manual process. Catalog operators must manually set up authorization policy.

### ESGF Replicator Application
[No significant changes since last month.]

The ESGF Replicator application is a planned ESGF application to be used by ESGF data node operators. When deployed and configured by an ESGF data node operator, the application will monitor the ESGF event stream for new and updated datasets. When datasets are seen that match a local replication profile, the application will create replicas of those datasets on the data node. If the data node is authorized to do so, the application will also update the datasets' entries in the ESGF STAC catalog to register the new replicas.

There is currently no written technical design for the ESGF Replicator application.  See the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ESGF2-us/esgf-replicator) for user stories, requirements, and key design points.

A new design team met for the first time on 2025-04-30 to review the materials above and begin planning an implementation strategy.
* We confirmed the approach of using esgpull as the basis for the replicator. This will represent a new usage mode for esgpull. Specifically, instead of the current mode which performs a **catalog search** for relevant datasets, this new mode will review **new publication events** on the ESGF event stream to identify relevant datasets.
* Several of the features on the replicator list are already on esgpull's agenda, and we'll rely on the existing team to implement these, with possible help from the replicator team.
* The ESGF2-US/Globus team will contribute Globus Transfer support to esgpull.
* The ESGF-NG team (mainly ESGF2-US and CEDA) will contribute event stream support (as an alternative to catalog search).
